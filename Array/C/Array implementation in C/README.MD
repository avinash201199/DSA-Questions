> Array implementation is done using C language  
> Features include traversal, insertion & deletion

# Why only C ?

- C is the mother of all computer languages  
- It's the most basic programming language which all coders, programmers as well as hackers should know.  
- C language engages with kernel/shell of your computer programs which makes it fast to compile & run  
- If you know C language, maximum programming languages you can learn by your own
- The most important thing, the environment where you run your code(i.e. compiler/interpreter) is also written in C language
